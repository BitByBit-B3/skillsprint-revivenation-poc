# Problem Statement

## Context & Pain Point

In Sri Lanka's rapidly evolving digital economy, there exists a critical gap between citizens' verified skills and accessible economic opportunities. The current freelance and gig economy landscape faces several fundamental challenges:

### The Skills Verification Crisis
- **Unverified Claims**: Freelancers struggle to prove their educational qualifications and skills to potential clients
- **Trust Deficit**: Employers hesitate to hire workers without government-verified credentials
- **Opportunity Loss**: Skilled individuals miss out on legitimate work due to lack of verifiable proof

### The Payment Insecurity Problem
- **Delayed Payments**: Freelancers often wait weeks or months for payment completion
- **Payment Disputes**: Lack of secure, traceable payment mechanisms leads to payment conflicts
- **Financial Exclusion**: Many skilled workers lack access to formal banking channels for receiving payments

### The Digital Identity Barrier
- **Fragmented Identity**: Citizens have multiple digital identities across different government services
- **Authentication Complexity**: Manual verification processes create friction in accessing opportunities
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users are hesitant to share personal data without proper consent mechanisms

## Evidence & Impact

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The Skilled Graduate**
- A recent university graduate with verified IT skills struggles to find freelance work
- Potential clients request proof of education, but manual verification takes days
- Result: Lost opportunities and income

**Scenario 2: The Rural Professional**
- A qualified teacher in a rural area wants to offer online tutoring
- No secure way to verify credentials or receive payments
- Result: Untapped skills and economic potential

**Scenario 3: The Informal Worker**
- A skilled craftsman wants to transition to digital platforms
- Lacks government-verified identity and payment mechanisms
- Result: Continued informal employment with limited growth

### Data Points

- **Identity Verification**: Only 40% of citizens have easily accessible digital identity verification (Source: Digital Sri Lanka Vision 2024 Progress Report)
- **Economic Impact**: Estimated $50M annual loss in freelance economy due to verification barriers (Source: Ministry of Digital Economy Report, 2024)
- **Digital Adoption**: 78% of Sri Lankan professionals use smartphones, creating opportunity for mobile-first DPI solutions (Source: Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, 2024)
- **Trust Factor**: 85% of employers prefer government-verified credentials over self-reported qualifications (Source: Skills Trust Index Survey, 2024)

## Scope of the Problem

### Target Group
- **Primary**: Skilled professionals seeking freelance opportunities
- **Secondary**: Small businesses and organizations needing verified talent
- **Tertiary**: Government agencies requiring skill verification for programs

### Geographic Scope
- **Primary**: Urban and semi-urban areas with digital infrastructure
- **Secondary**: Rural areas with growing internet connectivity
- **Future**: Nationwide expansion as digital infrastructure improves

### Problem Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Government-verified skills, secure payments, digital identity
- **Out of Scope**: Full employment platform, long-term contracts, complex project management

## The Opportunity

By addressing these interconnected challenges through government DPI (Digital Public Infrastructure), we can:

1. **Bridge the Trust Gap**: Connect verified government credentials with economic opportunities
2. **Accelerate Payments**: Provide instant, secure payment mechanisms
3. **Democratize Access**: Make government services accessible to all citizens
4. **Boost Economic Growth**: Enable the freelance economy to reach its full potential

The solution must integrate seamlessly with existing government infrastructure while providing a user-friendly experience that encourages adoption and trust.
